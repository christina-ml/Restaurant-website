<h2>History of Poutine</h2>
<p>Poutine (/puːˈtiːn/ poo-TEEN, Quebec French: [put͡sɪn]) is a dish of french fries and cheese 
  curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec 
  area, though its origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims of having invented 
  the dish. For many years it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to 
  stigmatize Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture. It 
  has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to popularity 
  throughout the rest of Canada, in the northern United States, and internationally.
